library(httr)
```

url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"

drug_use_html = read_html(url)
```

Get the pieces I actually need. the “note” at the bottom of the table
appears in every column in the first row. We need to remove that…

``` r
marj_use_df = 
  drug_use_html |> 
  html_table() |> 
  first() |> 
  slice(-1)
```

Read in cost of living data.

``` r
nyc_cost_df = 
  read_html("https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/new_york/new_york") |> 
  html_table(header = TRUE) |> 
  first()
```
